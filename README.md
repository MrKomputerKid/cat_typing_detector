# Cat Typing Detector

The **Cat Typing Detector** is a fun Python app that automatically detects when your cat is typing on your keyboard by recognizing specific typing patterns using lightweight machine learning. When cat-like typing is detected, the app redirects the activity to a friendly GUI window. It also integrates with the system tray, making it easy to run in the background and manage from the tray.

## Features

- Detects cat-like typing patterns using a machine learning model (Logistic Regression).
- Shows a special GUI window to notify the user when cat typing is detected.
- Includes a "Let me use my computer!" button for dismissing the cat-typing window.
- Integrates into the system tray for background operation.
- Tray menu allows the user to start, stop, or exit the detector easily.
- Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies:
  - **PyQt5**: For the GUI window.
  - **pystray**: For system tray integration.
  - **Pillow**: For creating tray icons.
  - **scikit-learn**: For the machine learning model.
  - **pynput**: For detecting keyboard inputs.

### Installation

First, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd CatTypingDetector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Simply run the Python script to start the system tray application:

```bash
python cat_typing_detector.py
```

Once running, youâ€™ll find the tray icon in your system tray. From there, you can:

    Start the cat typing detector.
    Stop it.
    Exit the application.

When the detector finds cat-like typing, it will pop up a window prompting you to enter "human" or click a button to dismiss the message.

### Packaging for macOS

To package the app for macOS:

Install py2app:

```bash
pip install py2app
```

Run the setup script to build the app:

```bash
python setup.py py2app
```

### Packaging for Windows

To create a standalone executable for Windows:

Install PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Generate the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed cat_typing_detector.py
```
### Packaging for Linux

For Linux, you can run the app as a background process using the nohup command:

```bash
nohup python cat_typing_detector.py &
```

Alternatively, you can create a systemd service for starting the app at boot.
